A 3 story Inn located in the shopping district of the City

The bar is owned and staffed by Vin.
Vin is short for [[Vincent]]. he and his party members after serving many years as adventurers to the city settled down and bought a modest Inn in the shopping district to compete with the other inn.

there pricing is more humble and there clientele a lot les lenient with the behaviour of the local authorities.

the bar is most frequented by local adventures and merchants as well as those from the middle class areas and dock districts. so you will get a lot of sailors and mercenaries mingling with merchants talking about trade routs, trade deals and the hiring of qualified adventures for protection duties.
