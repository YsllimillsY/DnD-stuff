His is the NPC ties to the quest [[Quest 3 - Dark Signs]]

they are actually an old god in mortal flesh.
they have been imprisoned there for there interference with the mortal plain.
the reason they have been imprisoned was for obsessing over the life of an individual mortal name [[Annabelle]]

they watched over them as a child and noticed that light did not work around the child.
they used there only power to create the light for them and sustain them for her.

once one of the higher up gods discovered this they were punished by forcing them into the body of a mortal and severing there memories of [[Annabelle]]

they missed a key component of this memory and Damion still felt love for her but never understood what it meant. this just drove them to once they encountered them to try and get close to them but still not have any memories.

over time the memories will return through interactions with [[Annabelle]] while on the quest with the players

this is shown by the flickering of old magic while he is in the presence of [[Annabelle]].
