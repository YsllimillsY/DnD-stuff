A Human Bard with little fame to his name as being one of the more chanrming mebers of the adventuring party The Managarie.

the party consisted of 

Vin a human. He/Him Bard
Feldon a dragonborn. He/Him Fighter
Gilda an Ork. She/Her Sorcerer
Tris a Tabaxi. She/Her Rogue
Dusty a Kenku. She/Her Barbarian

the party got there name from a misunderstanding where they were taking on a job at one point and were tasked with protecting a animal enclosure for a travaling group and somehow one of the members mistook Dusty for a member of the show and not an adventurer.

when they went missing all 4 of them tried to find them and eventually found them in one of the dages locked up. in the proicess of opening the cage and going inside something happened and the door locked with them all inside. the cage was later discovered with all 5 of them asleep in the cage just as a show was being put on and the name just stuck from that insident.
