The party makes a few brief checks before gathering backup together to discuss what has just transpired.

[[Yontha]] decides to approach the house of [[Annabelle]] to see if they can use her sway as an assistant of the guards to try and get her to come and talk with them. It's clear she's inside listening but is hesitant to come to answer the door.

[[Isha]] also approaches trying to assist as well as [[Oreye]] after they try to talk to the old one down the street in a series of different languages
(Charlie) uses a cantrip to ignite the lantern and keep it maintained each time it tries to go out

its after this that they notice someone at the window peeking out
[[Yontha]] tries to keep to see if it's [[Annabelle]] and confirms this before she quickly recedes from the window.

[[isha]] tries to cast message on [[Annabelle]] in order to tell her that they mean no harm and that they only came to help but due to a slipup have revealed that they already know about the light and what happening and they have come and been informed by [[Damion]].
This causes her to repel from the situation in anger and recedes deeper into the house leaving the party to know that this interaction is lost.

[[Oreye]] continues to keep the lantern lit in the hopes that it might bring her back.

[[Murkfirth]] then leaves to look at the old one that sits atop the room a little down the street that had been looking at [[Isha]] as they came out of the strange plain and begins to meditate in order to communicate with it.

[[Yontha]] also tries to communicate with it but it leads to no communication and wasted time for them both.

[[Yontha]] notices a series of bandits down near the seafront and decides to send up [[Jet plume]] to investigate. from this, they notice 3 down that street and a few moments later [[Jet plume]] notice 5 more down the street to the east.

preparing for a fight and readying to leave [[Isha]] begins walking north while [[Oreye]] continues to try to keep the flame light and stays behind.

[[Murkfirth]] also leaves and they eventually convince [[Oreye]] to leave with them as 3 bandits make themselves known down the eastern street and one stumbles from an ally not too far from them.

as the party flees north [[Yontha]] takes 10 gold and tosses it into the middle of the street towards the bandits while leaving and tries to make their non hostility clear.

quickly after 3 more bandits leave the northern street from beside them and one more well dressed bandit thanks them for their services and lets them leave unfollowed.

The party begins their journey towards the shopping district in the center of the city, passing the shipping district and eventually the gardens in search of room and board..

As they approach the gardens for the first time the high hedge walls come into view and glimpsing through the windows they see an array of local and exotic plants from around the continent and some from continents further afield.

They proceed into the shopping district and the wealth gap becomes vastly apparent between this district and [[Lower Greenknot - The Dregs]] the streets are far better kept and the buildings look pristine.

the venture a little deeper in to find themselves at [[The Mountain Ram]] a 3 story inn.
[[Isha]] shocks the building to test for suspicious entities and to the party's amaze one adventurer outside nots in understanding and briefly details his misfortune of encountering a mimic that took the form of a doll.

the party enters the bar and [[Yontha]] diverts off noticing a game being played to discover a table of men playing Liar's Dice.

[[Murkfirth]] proceeds to the bar to acquire details about the room and cost of stay and finds this place has an adventurers discount acquiring a 2 bedroom room for himself and [[Oreye]] as well as the bars finest imported mead setting them back 5 gold total(please correct me if i'm wrong 2 for bed and 3 for bottle)

[[Isha]] acquires room for themself and a cask of local made berry cider from the forests to the south of shanty.

The party then proceeds back to the table and begins chatting.
soon after [[Yontha]] joins the rest and they engage in some brief conversation.

no more than 20 mins later [[Damion]] comes through the door of the bar and is beckoned over wordlessly by [[Oreye]].

The party recalls the events to him what happened and to his horror they mention how they had brought up that you had helped them get there.

[[Isha]] tries to lie that they did not mention [[Damion]]s name and [[Yontha]] calls the bluff.

At this moment she passes into the other plane. Time stops and the world becomes soundless. [[Yontha]] realises that the perspective that they are currently seeing is inside of [[Isha]]s head. no thought is safe. Every question they could possibly desire is at their fingertips and must be true so the secret can be held from oneself.

She asks if they told [[Annabelle]] about [[Damion]] and confirmed it to be true by living inside the very memory of [[Isha]] while it was narrated by her.

after getting her answer became aware of the claustrophobic situation she was in and tried to recall from this and could not. She proceeds to ask a question that was easy to answer and already knows in order to try and escape without peering too deeply into her companions mind but finds herself becoming more at one with this place.

her reach expands outwards as she now has the ability to peer into the minds of all those around her and can see the world misshapen beyond her omnipotent vision. The world 20 feet from where she can perceive seems to be different, missing and in decay and atop the roof just outside of her reach she notices an old one sitting and looking directly at her.

She tries to extend her reach to communicate but is unsuccessful.
Desiring to leave this place she tries to read the mind of her feathered companion [[Jet plume]] and is unsuccessful again but notices amongst all the objects in the bar that have stopped moving the door of the bar is now swinging closed.

a figure comes up behind her and pets [[Jet plume]] on the head. praising her for her desire to not abuse the power she just possesses and her loyalty to her party. The figure says tell your friends I say hi and slaps her out of the plane and she then proceeds to slap herself wildly and confirms that [[Isha]] was lying and did in fact mention [[Damion]]s name.

This sends him into a saddened rage as he exclaims that she has ruined all his hard work with getting close to [[Annabelle]] and lets slip a part of his past about having amnesia and dreams of [[Annabelle]].

caught off by this the party questions him and he realises he has given himself up. He tells them that he needs a drink and then he will fill them all in.

a coin is passed to him as he heads to the bar.

[[Murkfirth]] follows him to the bar and tries to console him and ask further questions.
As he returns he accounts his tale to the party and [[Oreye]] senses a flickering of old god magic from him as he tells his tale.

He reveals that his dreams are of him seeing a girl that looks like [[Annabelle]] as a child throughout her life. and he appears to be looking down upon her watching as lanterns and lights don't seem to work around her. In his dreams he sees that lanterns and lights do work but he feels intrinsically tied to their working but can not explain it.

He only remembers opening his eyes 2 years ago outside the city of shanty and knowing nothing of himself or how he came to this city.
he acquired a job to live and as his dreams continued eventually met the woman from his dreams, [[Annabelle]].

The party asks what is his relation to her and he can only explain that she's a friend but beyond that he feels like he once loved her but can not place why.
