the session begins picking up talking with [[Damion]] about why he stumbled and fell over. its quickly discovered that he has no idea why he was knocked over.

[[Isha]] sends a message to [[Murkfirth]] related to the details about there most recent trip to the other plane and recommends we discuss later what had happened.

the party is then seen by [[Annabelle]] as she is about to leave the house and then quickly returns inside while [[Isha]] attempts to message her again.
this has no effect as she is clearly ignoring the voice she suddenly heard in her head.

the party decide that [[Murkfirth]] should be the one to take charger of the situation at the door and do all the talking.

upon knocking they hear shuffling inside and [[Annabelle]] asks who is it.
they coax her to open the door my informing her that they work for the city guard and she opens the door looking for them to present proof in the form of papers or a pin that is included in there welcome package.

after this she becomes excited that new people are hear to help but scornfully looks at [[Damion]] who she feels has betrayed her or has been lying about something.

after the party enter the house they get a brief look at the interior and notice its in a lot better condition then it is on the outside due to being well kept and decorated about the norm of an area of the poor district.

[[Annabelle]] lead them into the kitchen and they begin to talk about the issues. she makes the assumption that [[Damion]] has told them the ins and outs of the situation about how all light does not appear to work around her.

the party then begin a series of tests to try and figure out the ins and outs of this whole situation

[[Murkfirth]] places a lantern on the kitchen table and attempts to light it with with his tinder box but the flames keep extinguishing too quick to igniting the lantern.

[[Oreye]] uses a conjurer fire spell that flickers and dies when they do not hold concentration on the spell.

[[Isha]] has the idea to try and seek for a magical connection between the 2 due to suspicions about [[Damion]]. 
when asked to hold hands with [[Isha]], [[Annabelle]] takes her hand with no issue while [[Damion]] takes it with aprehension. its in that moment memebers of the party notice that he may think [[Annabelle]] to not have an inters in men! :P

it explained that he has a sort of pulsing of old magic about him when he it talking too or about [[Annabelle]] and that there appear to be a link to this.

it then becomes apparent that he has no recollection of the conversation that they had about him getting knocked over or the previous conversations about him giving off old magical energy. its as if he is forgetting all too do with it.

[[Isha]] can feel the pulsing of magic in him as if a pulse coming form his touch.

its in theses moments that the party decide to attempt to ignite some kind of flame and see if the light holds and it does.

the party then force [[Damion]] to tell the truth to [[Annabelle]] about the loss of his memories and his dreams that seem all to real of his past.

upon finishing his confession of the details [[Annabelle]] simply announces "Finally!" and pulls [[Damion]] close to her before casting some form of mass spell.

the party then find themselves in combat and suddenly are transported to different rooms of the house
