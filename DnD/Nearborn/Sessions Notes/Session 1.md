The party arrive at the guards quarters and meet the disgruntled near retirement age deck guard.
With some time they get there welcome packages and are sent to meet at the quest board outside the building.

they found 2 quest posted on the board.
one official looking quest for a missing person who has been missing for a week with a reward on the notice.
and one ,hand scrawled note that looked a lot less official.

a young guard in his 20s approaches the adventures after some rather loud discussion and introduces themselves as [[Danial]].

while he informs the adventures of the cities regulations around job postings and that the had written one is not official and will probably be ignored by the guards and scraped one of our adventures notices that the note got snatched away from under the board by someone and they follow in pursuit.

During this chase [[Oreye]] transforms into a phoenix in broad daylight and astonished many of the people in the streets.

after a short chase the adventured cornered a human man in an alleyway and after interrogating them casually for a few minuets he reveals his name to be [[Damion]].

They convince [[Damion]] to talk to them about the note and he brings them back to his home in the bottoms.

The party has begun the the [[Quest 3 - Dark Signs]]

while there the adventures learn of [[Annabelle]], the poster of the note and what it means by the lights don't work.
the lantern and all sources of light around the girl don't appear to work. but she very specifically keeps talking about a lantern outside her home that refuses to stay lit.

[[Murkfirth]] makes swamp tea while they talk with [[Damion]]

With some small convincing the party get [[Damion]] to bring them to where [[Annabelle]] lives but makes sure that they do net draw suspicion as she is very skittish.

Upon arriving in the lower district of Green Knot( the Dregs ) close to evening time [[Damion]] asks them to stay back while he enters to chat with [[Annabelle]].

the party explores the streets a little trying there best to seem in place and not snooping.

[[Oreye]] upon using detect magic outside the house senses the faint flickering of old god magic coming from the general direction of the 4 houses near [[Annabelle]]s. the flickering like that of a flint being struck but nothing lasting.

[[Yontha]] from her assessment of the lamp sees that it had been repaired recently enough in the last few months and looks in working order

[[Isha]] while trying to communicate with the lamp discovered a trapped bug beneath it and in a petty fit changed the bug into some form of hybrid species that is destined to die later that night.

[[Murkfirth]] notices that the streets are relatively quiet near night fall and simply tried to blend in while waitng to observer the lantern.

[[Isha]] then tries to hide in the ally to avoided detection to also observer the lamp.
for a brief few moments while remaining completely stealthy [[Isha]] passes into a plain between plains. memories of their existence in their word cease to exist and there very presence in the mortal plane is erased while they straddle this space. They remain there and watch in silence for fear of moving might break them from this wonder.

While there they can see the old gods more clearly and observe one that appears to walk/climb over an object that does not exist.

The guards light the lantern and all our members see [[Annabelle]] at the window for a brief moment before the flame extinguishes.

She then kicks [[Damion]] from the house as the guards chat about how its not working as always. they draw swords an [[Damion]] is kicked from the house suddenly and falls to the ground. He just explains they had a small fight before slowly rising and wondering off.

The guards check the lantern and ignite it once more. the flame lingers and just as [[Isha]] sees a flutter at the window an the flame dies.

then [[Isha]] senses a presence in the plane they are in behind them! its face shifting like it has no form before whispering "You dont belong here" and shoved [[Isha]] back to the mortal plain. they can still feel the touch of the entity that shoved them but memories of them feel like a dream that may fade if not focused on.

All the party members then remember that the party had 4 members but in a sense of nostalgia that they were always there. just remembering it like they always knew it.

[[Oreye]] then tries to detect magic as the flame extinguishes... and senses nothing.

[[Murkfirth]] then observes one of the old gods sitting on a roof across from the ally where Cat had been hiding. it appears t looking in Cats direction but its nor clear from the angle if its looking directly at them!
