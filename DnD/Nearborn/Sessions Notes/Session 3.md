The session begins with [[Isha]] wishing to have a conversation with [[Damion]] in order to try and make amends for their actions and mistakes made at [[Annabelle]]s place. while they ask [[Damion]] to come outside to somewhere more quiet [[Oreye]] decided to follow closely in order to make sure a fight does not break out.

while this happens [[Murkfirth]] and [[Yontha]] decide to leave to retire for the evening. [[Yontha]] looking to stay in the shared room with [[Oreye]] and [[Murkfirth]] but not paying for lodging.

She attempts to creep up the stairs but to her surprise a Kenku blocks the way to the third floor. they had clearly been alerted to her attempts and wished to send her back down to pay.

deciding to test their animal handling skills on them to change their luck and slips into the other plane.

While there they can see all living creatures within a 3 Kilometre radius. They succeed in charming the Kenku into being their friend and they have now acquired a companion for the next 3 days that will assist like a friend if needed.

further looking to bond further with [[Jet plume]] and can now emotionally connect with them for the next 3 days to further deepen their bonds.

After shifting their perception to see mostly the physical plane they notice that the world seems almost decayed around them. almost some kind of past or future of the building but not what they had been in moments ago.

After seeing the small spirit again above them and attempting to interact with it the old one acknowledges the attempt but does not understand.

they look beyond the Inn and see what can only be described as a giant moth like old god being held in place by magical chains that is linked to somewhere in the mages district to the north east of the inn

She then moves down the stairs and collides with an invisible just to her perception at present) creature and fumbles down the stairs landing on their chest with their beer spilling on her head.

she looks up and at the end of the hall is a shifting faceless old one. slender and with a face that all its features keep shifting around it in strange directions.

They speak again to [[Yontha]] and are pleased that they keep meeting but it is not yet time for them to meet properly. The old god bends over her on the floor and just pats her head and sends her back to her normal plane.

After all this she collects herself and sees the invisible dragonborn that was on the stairs. He remarks about her being drunk and then calls for Dusty(the Kenku) and says Vinâ€™s looking for us.

[[Yontha]] continues up the stairs to [[Murkfirth]] and tells him of what has just transpired, they discuss briefly what might be happening and then we cut to [[Isha]] and [[Oreye]] downstairs.

outside [[Isha]] has a conversation with [[Damion]] apologizing for their mess up and attempts to make amends with him. he apologizes for his outburst but he has already concocted a plan and intends to make [[Isha]] assist with clearing things up. They have a short conversation and then proceed inside and ask further questions about [[Damion]] to get some more insights on him but come up with the usual stories of all he remembers.

Everyone decides to retire feeling less drunk than they should be from drinking an amount of beer they thought would have them well on their way and [[Damion]] leaves for home.

[[Oreye]] gets to the room and is told about all the things that were seen by [[Yontha]] and decides to have a look in phoenix form.

They spend 2 hours detecting magic in the area of the moth and slowly trace the tainted magic to its source. a courtyard in the mages district and encounter an alarm ward over the courtyard and decide not to enter.

They further explore the surrounding area and find that the courtyard is attached to the office of the arch mage of the city.

on the way home they take a detour and quickly scout [[The Gardens]]. they sense a strong presence of old magic in the gardens before getting back to the inn and inform [[Yontha]] and [[Murkfirth]] of the findings

The next morning [[Oreye]] goes and orders breakfast for [[Yontha]] and [[Murkfirth]] and then awaits them waking in the room. Some time later a knock at the door comes and a Kenku is there holding the 2 br
[[Isha]] claims the keg must have been tampered with and the bar man [[Vincent]] is appalled at the accusations.

When the others arrive down they share in some details but more so begin formulating the plan to try and recover from the actions of [[Isha]] the following day.

the plan is to convince [[Annabelle]] that it was only on coincidence that [[Damion]] bumped into the adventurers and that he gave them assistance with guiding them down to her house as he happened to be in the area and wanted to check on her latest posting to the job board.

The party after this decided to make their way to [[Annabelle]]s house in [[Lower Greenknot - The Dregs]] early in the day in order to sort things out.

[[Yontha]] engages in a conversation with [[Damion]] about his past and relation to [[Annabelle]] and appears to stir up some kind of thought from him but he does not vocalise it.

[[Yontha]] then investigates deeper into this but finds only that [[Damion]] does not recall when he was feeling only that it felt like a lost thought.

[[Isha]] decides to also probe into [[Damion]]s actions to attempt to discern more information from this action.

in doing so they found themself inside of [[Damion]]s very mind where they could discover any piece of information they wish to discover about him

They look to the moments mentioned in his past before his very memories begin to him and find themself facing a large ethereal wall that has manifested in his mind, a metaphor for what is blocked off from him remembering and the source of his supposed amnesia.

They tough the wall with their hand to try and find some form of opening and feel the cold of this barrier against their hand only for then a series of fingers reach from the wall and begin dragging them in.

Slowly but surely their arm becomes consumed beyond the wall as they wish to know more beyond it but do not know if beyond it means death.

After the arm is just beyond the elbow [[Isha]] begins to pull back and eventually pulls the other arm from the wall and eventually a formless face appears to come through the wall.

The shifting one's eyes set in place as they stare directly at [[Isha]] and begin talking.

They declare them quite nosey and tell them to stop getting in the way of them messing about with their playthings.

The shifting one then uppercuts [[Isha]] in the jaw and sends them whirling back into their own consciousness and [[Damion]] gets knocked over from the sudden force of the punch but does not feel as if anything actually hit him.
