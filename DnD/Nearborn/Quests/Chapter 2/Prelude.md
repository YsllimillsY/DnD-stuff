after the battle at the Manor with the BBEG the player exit to find the city was also suffering from the convergence and many of the Old Gods became violet towards the mortal.

a high death count has cause the cemetery of shanty to be full and over a hundred bodies need to be laid to rest in the sea.

special vestals are crafted in the mages quarters for the containment of the bodies to sing them into the bay where they can be buried beneath the sea but preserved in the capsule.

this is where out driving force for the next part of the adventure arrives.
enter [[Captain Kuro]] a man who was exiled to the midlands and prevented from ever venturing on the sea for his misdeeds in the past.

a letter was left in the guards quarters long ago during his exile that stated "call me when they bury the bodies underwater, its blue light over murder for me"

[[Captain Kuro]] will have a brief interaction with the party by the bay as they watch over the funeral and then head back into the city.

they will then encounter him again at the bar where they can converse and hear of his sea faring days and learn of his "Ship" The Jewel of the Deep. a submarine like vestle that he once used to control the the southern sea since not other vestile like it existed he went uncontested.

the machines relied on a combination of magic and science to work and mages of the modern work refused to blend the 2 so heavily so as to keep there secrets hidden.

fortunately for [[Captain Kuro]] he made friends is strange places and mages from other lands were far more likely to not care about the established magical order when turning to piracy.
