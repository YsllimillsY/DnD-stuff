no details on how to encounter the quest

the combat for this will be on the sea floor. in a region of the sea where there is a brine sea( a kind of more dense water that exists at the bottom of an expanse of the sea where the slat is more dense and the minerals of the sea floor make it uninhabitable by most life)

the players will face an enemy that hides beneath this surface making there location unknown to the players till the turn before each of their attacks. and they will spend 1 turn above before submerging again. this will be like a fight against an kraken where it will have multiple appendages that the players must defeat to engage the final fight

combat in the ocean will be slowed.
movement will be halved and attacking will cost both an action and bonus action if the attack is physical.
