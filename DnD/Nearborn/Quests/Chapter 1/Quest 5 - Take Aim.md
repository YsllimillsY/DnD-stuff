 
A huntress has noticed a strange phenomenon that has been happening on her hunts.  
  
It appears that she has become far more profitable than any other local hunter in the city and can not explain why. It's as if the animals are seeing her out and even some have moved into the line of fire.  
  
Some strange magic seems at play.  
  
The culprits is a wizard who has imprisoned a God and is using the gods power to manipulate the animals to his will and help the huntress.  
He does this out of obsession and seeks to fulfill a ritual he has heard of in an ancient tomb.  
  
This ritual involves one person taking lives willingly. Then hexing them as they reach a certain threshold of kills. The next kill is linked to there own life and when killed they will also perish.  
The wizard wishes to link his own life to the animal she will kill so they can accend to the heavens together and be united and bound is spirit form for eternity.
