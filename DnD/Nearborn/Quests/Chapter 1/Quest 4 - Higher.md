The party will here commotion from inside the room. An argument has broken out.  
  
They bust in only to find that they are blocked by a barrow as the two argue.  
The God made mortal is cowering from the[[Annabelle]] and it becomes clear that she is not what the party believed them to be.  
[[Annabelle]] resents the God for abandoning them but it was that moment that forged there path for the past 10 years into dark practices.  
  
They sought after this light that left them and through years of study of magic and the gods they found a means of producing this light but it was a sickly red light that paled in comparison of that of the gods. A bloody path of dead body's and betrays has gained them and they sought to become a God themselves in there search for this light.  
  
Now they believe that killing this God become mortal is there gateway to godly-hood.  
  
The party watches as they slaughter this mortal and  now they face the party glowing with a silly ref light and and an animated dead God at there side who radiates a white/purple colour.
