Quest : the Manor!  
  
Castle [[Nearborn]] is a glamour, the guards at the gates will repeat the same dialog each and every time you pass the gates.  
The party if they open the games the guards will acknowledge them.  
If they have completed 6 quests the younger guard will smile and say...  
I have been expecting you!  
The gates will open and the flame will be unveiled through them.  
The manor is is shambles and looks long since abandoned in some areas and other it looks still new and another still under construction. This seems to change as they keep watching as they notice that this keeps changing.  
The manor is effected by some kind of time manipulation.  
  
This is the home of the BBEG the faceless one. And old got who has been playing games with the city and is the one causing the event that will be called the convergence!  
  
The Convergence : this is the phenomenon of people and gods interacting with each others worlds. It's happening all over the city in small pockets and effects the party on Nat 20 rolls.  
This also Grant's the boon of critical on 19 and 20s
Rolling a further Nat 20 while in this cause the ability of the user to expand beyond its initial range
