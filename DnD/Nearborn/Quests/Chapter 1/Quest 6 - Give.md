A rogue God has taken us reside in the city. They control people. through infatuation but pray on people who give into there carnal desires and malicious intent.  
They replicate themselves and seek week individuals in the slums of the city. They ensnared them by pleading with them to give into the desires they are feeling, be they sexual, hate or intent to kill.  
  
Through engaging in the acts they give into the gods alure and after committing the act they are consumed by the God.
