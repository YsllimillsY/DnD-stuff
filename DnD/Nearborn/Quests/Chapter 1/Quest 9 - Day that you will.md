Another series of killings has begun to happen on the streets of Shanty, this time more ritualistic then the last.  
The murderer appears to be capturing his victims and slaughtering them at locations that are know for the appearance of a select few of the old gods.  
  
The murderer creates alters at the sites and appears to take his time with the kill.  
All of them appear to happen in the late hours of the night in order to prevent passerby's attention but some citizens have seen the man but say nothing out of fear that it may make them the next target.  
  
The party will overhear a conversation in the dregs or the bottoms that will lead them on this quest.  
They will first visit the funeral of the first victim and from there they will receive clues about the ongoing investigation.  
This quest is drawn out as the murderer is a lot more patient and only kills once a week or 2.  
  
When they finally catch up to the murderer they may overhear the conversation between them and an old god. This conversation will be one sided to them unless they have some way to plain shift briefly or something of the likes.  
  
This conversation reveals that they are doing the murders to win favor with this old god but they are aware that this may not gain them favor but they do this to Express there love for the old god and wish to please them and be with them.  
  
This murderer is a high born mage from the magical district who has become so infatuated with this old god that they are in a frenzy of killing and pushing for them.  
  
Combat will be them verses this high born mage who is being assisted by the old god in ethereal form. The god will act like a liar action by summoning one of the spirits of the murdered to the images side and causing terrain changes to make combat more dynamic.
