 
There is rumor of a crazed man slaughtering people throughout the city.  
He claims to be hunting and punishing the gods for there misdeeds and dwelling among us.  
  
The party will encounter 3 different murder scenes where an individual has been butchered beyond belief and sever arcane symbols have been scrawled around the scene in what appears to be the victims blood(its actually the murders)  

1 note id found at the first and second scene giving a hint to the next murder.

note 1 :
They walk among us. in suites made from our flesh.
inhabiting the being while there subconscious rests.
the first of many and a beautiful beginning 
lets see how the chancellor likes it when his niece dies screaming.

note 2 :
Two down and many many more to go.
i will rote them out of their worldly hold!
theses abominations posses mortal life
but now that their mortal i will make them know strife
The High mages daughter will come to know Slaughter
  
Through assessing the scenes each leading from one to the next they decoder who the next victim is going to be. They attempt to make it to the scene and find the madman in the process off carving up the body of a woman as her wife is tied up to watch as he screams about how you will seen now with this final cut as the spirit will be releases from the body.  
  
The party will choose to intervene and come face to face with a killer. they are an ordinary human and the fight will be incredibly underwhelming.

the person who the killer has targeted will not die and be saved. this will come back to bite them in the ass as the now petty old god swears vengeance all all of the mortal race

Upon beating the sorcerer you will discover that the killings were instigated by his partner who grew tired of the mortal plain and wished to be free and to free their partner so that could re ascend.
