 
This quest takes place in the cities arena.  
This is a a gladiator style arena where combatants fight for glory and to appease the old god that sits on the rock in the middle of the arena.  
They are a small nymph like god that relishes in the sport of belly and seems to feed from the blood of the defeated.  
Anyone who sets foot in the arena feels the alore of the god calling them to fight for them and being glory to your name.  
The party who can be effected will be ensnared and drawn to the arena as combatants. In the arena your skills re heightened(all attack rolls are max damage and caters find there spells slots work for 2 casta each)  
  
The real story revolves around the current champion if the arena who has held the position for some time.  
If the party visits the arena by night they will find him out on the stone communicating with the god laying with his head in their lap. There is a level of intimacy between them that is beyond anything they have seen between mortals and the old gods.  
The party will be able to see beyond the glamour of the god if one is immune to it or they aquire something to help but there shape is not there true one. They actually are one with the rock beneath the arena, this whole arena is a gaping maw of the old god where they are feeding from the loyalty,blood and commitment to them they feel in this area. Shutting down the arena is the only solution to this problem right now till the party finds a means of killing the gods in their plain.
