### Background Knowledge

Due to your extremely long lifespan you have been round the world and witnessed 3 great wars on the continents.
the first was the continent you currently reside on, Argrond.
this was the first great war that broke out in the kingdoms of man and was what defined the borders of countries under the rule of the first Great King Damian( this then became a popular baby name)
that happened 300 years ago.
next was the great war of the other continent that had no name at the time but has now been named Zward.
this also happened about 300 years ago but closer to 280. took them a few years and some influential people crossing the seas to desire to unite the continent under one rule.
and lastly was the most recent war. the war on the old one. this was an espionage war between the continents to be the first to discover the origin of the old ones. this began 100 years ago and some say to this day is still being waged but no one really knows.

Shanty is the main sea port of Argond where the first ships as part of this great expedition into finding out about the old gods began.
