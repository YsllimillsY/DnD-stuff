### Backstory
Isha’s life has not been boring but not massively exciting, offspring of the air genasi sorcerer Naya breezehome and the djinn Da-zal. Isha felt she/they always had to excel where their parents' talents came to them naturally. Ishas hard work in the study of magic paid off where her diplomacy classes suffered as they did not get on well with others in school and then accepting a full scholarship of (insert mage college here). On the day of her acceptance her mother gifted her with the family jewel a pale yellow topaz to use as her arcane focus and for luck.  
  
Isha quickly started to excel in her classes, but with rapid progress and growth of their magical prowess turned to rapid frustration with her piers inability to keep up as she became bored with her peers and began to play “pranks”  on them making their lives the most inconvenient but in the tiniest ways but tweaking it for a vocal trigger. These pranks became such an issue and unstable, the college decided to …reward them…with a sabbatical time of free travel as an adventurer in training. Unknowingly to her, their parents' reputation and their clear prowess with experimental magic is the only reason Isha isn’t just suspended or expelled. 

After several months and multiple attempts to join several parties in failure. Isha finds themselves the sole survivor of a party who tried to shut down a “sugar” den of a local crime lord. She tried to cover her tracks but doesn’t exactly know if they were successful. They make their way to Shanty to hopefully find enough money and power to return a successful adventurer.
