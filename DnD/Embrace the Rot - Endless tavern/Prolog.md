The campaign begins with the PC's in a village when a commotion causes there attention to be drawn to something happening in the streets.

townsfolk are shouting indistinctly and you overhear the word monster mixed in with the shouting.

the PC's leave the tavern and come across some form of disfigured humanoid walking into the town at a slow pace.

as the PC's get closer to the beast and prepare for combat the monster begins to speak.
"Please help me! i mean you know harm but please i beg of you ... [cough]... i need a healer!"

If the party has a healer they may try to help in this moment and cure wounds will save the individual for a period of time but the healer will be inflicted with a disease debuff for their actions.

Either way the NPC will tell the PC's of the town know and Decay. a town to the west that sits in the shadow of the mountain and built partially into the cliffs.

If the party has not healed the NPC they will pass away during this conversation not giving the full details of the town.

if they do cure the NPC they will find out more details about the workings of the town and that it si controlled by the Lord Nargel and his wife Ereshkigal.
they will be told that all the people of the town are infected with a series of diseases that only effect them if they attempt to leave the city and are all in turn trapped under the oppressive controls of the lord(this is untrue, most the people are happy apart from a small insurgence that wish top leave due to being discontent with only living in the town).

to enter the town the PC's must find the cross rods that is set at the foot of the mountain. at the center of the road they must dig up the box and place a possession of theirs in this box that is is some emotional value to them(this is a sign of giving up a piece of themselves for safe passage into Decay and is actually the pact they make with Nergel for protection from the diseases they will be inflicted with while in the town)

the players will then begin passing into the shadow of the mountain and find themselves looking for a crevasse in the rock. upon finding it the players find themselves wondering in the dim light of the cave for a short while and final emerge to the great city of DECAY!

a hollow in the mountain( a volcanic crater) where a huge botanical garden and a city rests with the sky clearly open to it. the PC's look to their rear and find that the passage they walked through no longer exists.
