Helium punk setting where helium balloons and technology is more used.
the world kept tot eh style of clothing from the 1920s but evolved socially.
kind of like mob bosses and smoke houses with the hint of prohibition! :P

zeppelins are the main form of mas transport and smaller versions of it using a more pure version of helium allows for refined and more compact versions for every day use.

bikes that use a stabilization system above a zeppelin around the same size of a car is used am the main mode of local transportation. keeping low to the ground for safety only riding a max of 30ft in the air and using a propulsion system of fans and gas ejection for movement

forms of hovercraft like cars are used for transport across land and lakes.
boloon lifts on the exteriur of the buildings are used for elivators

floating islands above the city suspended by a multitude of boloons and tethers to keep them to the ground are vistable locations

helium is discovered to be a byproduct of certain radioactive materials as they decay. this process is limited so the creation of radioactive material is used for harnessing theses devices( yes they are on the cusp of nuclear power) and in turn take time to "Charge"(replenish gas) after use.
