the character in the lead spots the trap automatically if his or her passive Wisdom (Perception) score is 12 or higher.

Otherwise, the character must succeed on a 
DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check

If the character fails to notice the trap, he or she triggers the snare and must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw.

On a failure, the character is suspended upside down 10 feet above the ground. The character is restrained until 1 or more slashing damage is dealt to the snare's cord. A character who isn't carefully lowered down takes 

Id6 bludgeoning damage from the fall
